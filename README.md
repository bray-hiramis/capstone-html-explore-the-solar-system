# ðŸŒŒ Explore the Solar System

This is my **HTML Capstone Project** for the freeCodeCamp Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum.  
It's a beginner-friendly web page that showcases the wonders of our solar system using clean HTML structure and semantic tags.

## ðŸ“š What I Learned

- How to use semantic HTML elements like `<header>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`
- How to organize content using proper indentation and structure
- How to create links, lists, and simple layouts
- The importance of accessibility and clean code

## ðŸš€ What's Next

I'm currently moving on to the **CSS** portion of the course to bring more life and style to my projects.
